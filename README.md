# Amber
*A [leftwm](https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm) minimalistic theme with very few gadgets, widgets and modules*


# Disclaimer
At the moment Amber is more like a rolling-release-theme, but I'll try to mark the main changes in the changelog below.

Also development and tests are done on ArcolinuxB, so it likely that distro would automatically satisfy most if not all dependencies.

# Installation
1. Install all required dependencies

2. Clone the repository in ~/.config/leftwm/themes

```BASH
cd ~/.config/leftwm/themes
git clone https://github.com/di-effe/amber.git
```

3. Remove the symlink to your current theme if set

```BASH
rm ~/.config/leftwm/themes/current
```
4. Set this as your current theme

```BASH
ln -s ~/.config/leftwm/themes/amber ~/.config/leftwm/themes/current
```

5. Restart your window manager

```Default shortcut
$MOD + Shift + r
```
**!!! IMPORTANT !!!**

Polybar is configured with an application launcher (left side) and a powermenu (right side). Both require **rofi** to be installed on your system, if you want to use them.


# Configuration

## Keymap
At the moment this is a simple and dirty snippet of code placed in the *up* file

```
# KEYMAP

KEYBINDINGS=/tmp/leftwm-keybindings
if [ -f "$KEYBINDINGS" ]; then
    rm $KEYBINDINGS
fi
leftwm-check -v | \
grep Keybind | \
sed -e "s/Keybind: Keybind { command: //g;s/ } true//;s/ } false//" \
> $KEYBINDINGS


KEYMAP=/tmp/leftwm-keymap
if [ -f "$KEYMAP" ]; then
    rm $KEYMAP
fi

sort $KEYBINDINGS | \
tr -d '"' | \
sed -e "s/modifier: //g;s/key: //;s/value: None//;s/value: Some(//;s/)//;s/modkey,/modkey +/" | \
awk -F, '{print $3","$4","$1","$2}' | \
column -s ',' -t \
> $KEYMAP
```

What id does, hopefully, is to retrieve all key bindings to create a keymap to show using rofi.
My config.toml file is configured like this:

```
[[keybind]]
command = "Execute"
value = "rofi -dmenu -input /tmp/leftwm-keymap -window-title 'Keymap' -theme ~/.config/leftwm/themes/amber/rofi/keymap.rasi"
modifier = ["modkey", "Shift"]
key = "k"
```


## dmenu
I am using a custom dmenu color scheme. If you like to use pick it from the config.toml in this repository or configure yours like this:

```
[[keybind]]
command = "Execute"
value = "dmenu_run -p 'Run: ' -nb '#ffb300' -nf '#000000' -sb '#333333' -sf '#FFFFFF'"
modifier = ["modkey"]
key = "p"
```

## Layout module
By default the layout module is configured in the template.layout file
```
%{O20}
%{A1:leftwm-command "NextLayout" :}%{A3:leftwm-command "PreviousLayout" :}
%{F#ffb300}Óùö%{F-} [{{ workspace.layout }}]
%{A}%{A}
```
You can chose to 
- remove it, deleting those lines
- keep it aligned to the left, but change the offset in the %{O20} field (those are 20 pixels)
- move it to the center of the screen, replacing %{O20} with %{c}

If you prefer to manage the module in your polybar.config file I left two modules
- layout0, for workspace0
- layout1, for workspace1


## Wallpapers

*up* is configured with the options to
- set random wallpapers from the /wallpapers folder
- set ONE wallpaper for all displays
- set MULTIPLE wallpapers for all displays (default)

Uncomment what you prefer and comment the rest. It should be clear enough reading the file.
